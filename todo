# TODO Shortterm

* Finish cleaning data
* Find a way to predict scale
* Convert scale to roman numerals
* Calculate probabilities of chord degree changes
  * Calc probs for each scale, e.g. C major, D major etc 
  * Calc probs for scale class, e.g. major, minor and maybe others?

# TODO Longterm

* Finish my progresh mode: The idea is you have 1, 2, or maybe 3 chords and want to complete the progression.
